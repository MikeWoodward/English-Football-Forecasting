# Blog posts built from data and analysis in this project

I'm writing a number of blog posts on analysis derived from this data. You can see all of them on my blog using this link: https://blog.engora.com/search/label/football. Here's a list of them.

* Win, lose, or draw: trends in English football match results - https://blog.engora.com/2025/06/english-football-data.html
* G-O-A-L! Goals in English football - https://blog.engora.com/2025/07/g-o-l-goals-in-english-football.html
