# Data sources for this project

# No (free) golden source

There's been a tremendous interest in modeling football data for some time now, so it's surprising how bad the free data sources are. 

* Many sources have incorrect data (date of match, goals scored) for historic matches (meaning, pre-WWII) and some even have incorrect match dates and results for matches since 2010.

* Many sources are incomplete, meaning they miss out matches and teams for some older seasons.

* Club names are inconsistently abbreviated.

* The same errors appear in multiple sources, suggesting a large amount of cutting-and-pasting. In other words, different sources are not always different.

# Quality checking methodology

I did two forms of quality checking: 

* Cross-checking sources against each other and manually checking the differences.
* Manually checking - meaning searching for the match on the internet. I considered some sources authoratative, e.g. old match programs, media reports, fan historic sites. Fortunately, I managed to find authoritative sources for every match.

# ENFA

This is the best data. I only found three errors in the entire data set.

# Football league web pages

# Football club history

Clubs have merged, renamed themselves, gone bankrupt etc. etc. This site has helped me keep the naming straight: https://www.fchd.info/indexs.htm
