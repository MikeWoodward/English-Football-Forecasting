# Points

The clubs in the leagues are ranked by their number of points. At the end of each season, the top teams in the league are eligible for promotion to the next league up, and the bottom teams might be relegated to the league below. Bear in mind, money is not equally divided, so promotion can have a massive financial boost and relagation a financial penalty.

Up until the 1981 season, match points were awarded as follows:
* Loss: 0 points
* Draw: 1 point
* Win: 2 points  

In England, from 1981 onward, the system changed:
* Loss: 0 points
* Draw: 1 point
* Win: 3 points  

The intention of awarding 3 points was to encourage teams to go for a win rather than settling for a draw.

# The English football league structure

English football has undergone a number of organizational changes over the years, including a number of confusing name changes. However, the basic structure has stayted the same: a hierarchical set of leagues with promotion and relegation between them.

At the time of writing (mid-2025), there are five national professional leagues. Below these leagues are semi-professional regional leagues. The top league (the EPL) takes the lion's share of the available money and the money falls off the lower down the league system you go.

The table below is a simplified version of the league structure over time.

| Tier    | League name | Number of clubs |

# Oddities

Matches were suspended during most of the First and Second World War.

A number of teams have gone bankrupt which is a breach of Football Association rules. In most cases, these teams have been resurrected under new names (so-called phoenix clubs), and again in most cases, these teams have reclaimed their old names after a few years.

The Football Association (FA) has penalized clubs for breach of its financial rules and several other issues. These penalties have been fines and/or points deductions. In a few cases (most notably, Dover Athletic), the FA has "canceled" match results, and in a few cases, the FA has awarded the match points to a club even though the match wasn't played.
