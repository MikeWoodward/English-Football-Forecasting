# Points

The clubs in the leagues are ranked by their number of points. At the end of each season, the top teams in the league are eligible for promotion to the next league up, and the bottom teams might be relegated to the league below. Bear in mind, money is not equally divided, so promotion can have a massive financial boost and relagation a financial penalty.

Up until the 1981 season, match points were awarded as follows:
* Loss: 0 points
* Draw: 1 point
* Win: 2 points
In England, from 1981 onward, the system changed:
* Loss: 0 points
* Draw: 1 point
* Win: 3 points
The intention of awarding 3 points was to encourage teams to go for a win rather than settling for a draw.

# The English football league structure

English football has undergone a number of organizational changes over the years, including a number of confusing name changes. However, the basic structure has stayted the same: a hierarchical set of leagues with promotion and relegation between them.

At the time of writing (mid-2025), there are five national professional leagues. Below these leagues are semi-professional regional leagues. The top league (the EPL) takes the lion's share of the available money and the money falls off the lower down the league system you go.
