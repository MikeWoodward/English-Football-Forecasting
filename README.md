# English Football Forecasting
Project to forecast English football results. This is a work in progress.

This work is based on an earlier project I did in R. I had several goals here:
1. Use the project as a demo vehicle for using Cursor on a large machine learning project.
2. Add new data to the model.
3. More sophisticated data analysis looking for features.
4. More in-depth investigation of neural nets and other machine learning approaches.
