# Python-EPL-forecasting
Project to forecast EPL results. This is a work in progress.

This work is based on an earlier project I did in R. I had several goals here:
1.  Use the project as a demo vehicle for using Cursor on a large machine learning project.
2.  Add new data to the model.
3.  More in-depth investigation of neaural nets.
