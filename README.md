# English Football Forecasting
This is a project to forecast English football league results (excluding cup matches, international games, friendlies etc.). It's a work in progress. It's based on a project I did some time ago in R.

I have several prject goals:
1. Use the project as a demo vehicle for using Cursor on a large machine learning project.
2. Add new data to the existing model.
3. More sophisticated data analysis than before looking for features.
4. More in-depth investigation of neural nets and other machine learning approaches.

Here's how the project is structured:
* Data downloads - most of the code that deals with getting the data. There are a number of data sources I used and some I stopped using.
* Data preperation - extracts data from the data sources, combines it, and cleans it up.
* Analysis - data anlsysis.
* Notes - project notes.
