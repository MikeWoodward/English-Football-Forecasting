* What is this code?

After analyzing the data, I wanted to do something a bit more sophisticated, which meant creating a database and adding the data to it. I decided to use a Postgres database. This code builds on the previous data to build a Postgres database and checks that the database is consistent.

** What's missing

I haven't added data on the club grounds. It turns out, this is a bit more complicated and hard to get than I thought. Although the ground is identified in all match reports, details on the grounds (e.g. capacity, seating/standing, etc.) are hard to come by.
