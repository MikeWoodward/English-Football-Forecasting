# Recommendations for rolling out generative AI to data science and technical teams

## Summary - proceed with caution

There are substantial productivity gains to be had from rolling out generative AI for code generation to data science teams, but there are major issues to be managed and overcome. Without effective leadership, including expectation setting, roll-outs will fail. 

## Introduction - why, who, and how

This is a guide for rolling out generative AI, meaning code generation, for data science teams. It covers the benefits you might expect to see, the issues you'll encounter, and some suggestions for coping with them. I'm writing this in June 2025, and using the Cursor IDE, along with Claude, Open AI and other code generation LLMs. I'm aware that not everyone knows what Cursor and the other agentic AI-enabled IDEs are, so I've added a section at the end of this document to explain what they are and what they do.

Although I'm focused on data science, all my comments apply to anyone doing technical coding, by which I mean code that's algorithmically complex or uses "advanced" statistics. This can include people with the job titles "Analyst" or "Software Engineer".

## Benefits

Cursor can automate a lot of the "boring" stuff that consumes data scientist's time, but isn't core algorithm development. Here's a list:

* Commenting code. This includes function commenting using, for example, the Google function documentaiton format.
* Documentation. This means documenting how code works and how it's structured.
* Boilerplate code. This includes code like reading in data from a data source.
* PEP8 compliance. It can restructure code to meet PEP8 requirements.

There are other key advantages:

* Code completion. Given a comment or a specifc prompts, Cursor can generate code blocks, including using the correct API parameters. This means less time looking up how to use APIs.
* Code generation. Cursor can generate the outline of functions and much of the functionality, but this has to be well-managed.

Overall, if used corectly, Cursor can give a *significant* productivity boost for data science teams.

## Problems

It's not plain sailing, there are several issue to overcome to get the productivity benefits.

### It's not a notebook

On the whole, data scientists don't use IDEs, they use notebooks. Cursor, and all the other agentic IDEs, are not notebooks. This is **the** most important issue to deal with and it's probably going to be the biggest cause of roll out failure.

Notebooks have features that IDEs don't, specifically the ability to do "data interactive" development and debugging. This is the key reason why data scientists use notebooks. Unfortunately, none of the agentic AI systems have anything that comes close to the power of notebooks.


### Expectations


### A realistic vew of code generation for data science

### Data scientists are not software engineers and neither is Cursor

## Ways of working
